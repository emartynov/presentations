# Test fixtures with AGP

The test fixtures made much simplification in our project. While it is still experimental and has issues I decided to
speak about my/our experience and current setup.

It is also continuation of the two articles I posted:

1. [Android project test fixtures](https://medium.com/p/dec50c5d8533)
2. [Android Gradle plugin with Test Fixtures support](https://medium.com/@emartynov/android-gradle-plugin-with-test-fixtures-support-411383320980)
