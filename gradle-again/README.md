## Gradle Again 

The talk I gave at first online DAUG meetup.

The main points from talk:
1. Think about your project graph
2. Correctly declare module dependencies
3. Automate correctness checks
4. Keep an eye on the unnecessary tasks in your build
5. Reflection as alternative for the code generation

There will/might be video of the talk.
